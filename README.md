# DataWorks Open Source Policy
Policy and Guidance from the DWP DataWorks team on working with Open-Source code.

This policy is guided (but not restricted) by the following:

_**If in doubt consult with your security point of contact**_

The policies in this repo should be split into separate files, but linked to from this readme.
