# DataWorks Documentation Style Guide

## Purpose

This document is the style guide for documentation and diagrams produced by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) DataWorks team.

## Scope

This policy covers all DataWorks documentation and designs.


## Format

Documentation should be published in Markdown language. This provides a consistent format for project/service documentation which is simple, portable, text-based, and enables version changes to be easily easily caputured as diffs.

Diagrams should be published in a format which can be easily modified, so that anyone who needs to change a diagram can so this without having to re-create that diagram from scratch. The preferred format of the team is to create diagrams using draw.io and to publish these as a .png which incorporates the XML metadata required to enable editing.

Documentation and diagrams must be subject to peer review before publication, and changes to these must be treated like code changes.

## Content

Documentation should only be created if it serves a clear and useful purpose; the purpose and scope of each document should be made clear at the start. When documentation ceases to be useful it should be retired.

Documentation should not repeat verbatim other information which is contained elsewhere. Use references instead.

The meaning behind all policy statements should be clearly articulated:
* This approach promotes "intelligent challenge" to policy statements, validating the underlying logic, enabling feedback on alternative ways to meet the underlying requirements, and documenting policy-driving constraints which might change with time. This, in turn, drives improvements in policy and enables it to more easily evolve as circumstances change.
* It is impossible to fully prevent "unintelligent challenge", where an individual objexts to a policy statement because of some philosophical objection or simply because it is inconvenient for them. However, this approach does make it easier to address such challenges through reference to the policy.

Diagrams should be in the form of an architectural pattern or be reusable as one.
